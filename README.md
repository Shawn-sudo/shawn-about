## [My About Website](https://seihyun.atrable.com)
Used [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting)

Migrated from React to Gatsby for better experience (I mean, better site exploring experience for crawling bots).

The navigation bar used to have a cool transitioning animation, but it's gone after migrating to Gatsby ðŸ˜•
