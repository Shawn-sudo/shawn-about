                  <p>There are a lot of natural phenomena that fascinate me.</p>
                  <p>
                    For example, I was pouring a handful of salt into the water.
                    I thought that it might be too much, but the water dissolved
                    the salt very well. I poured a little more salt, and the
                    water could still dissolve it. In my view, water was
                    unexceptionally good at dissolving salt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Later, I learned that Oxygen has a higher electronegativity
                    than Hydrogen, which causes the electrons to tend to stay
                    near Oxygen. This eventually causes the polarity of the
                    water molecule, which makes water to be good at dissolving
                    ions and polar molecules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it is shown in my experience of pouring salt into the
                    water, many factors are related to a chemical reaction, even
                    if it is simple. It is interesting for me to learn and
                    research how elements and compounds interact with each
                    other.

                    I used to be interested in airplanes when I was 12. I tried
                    to run&nbsp;
                    <a
                      href="https://www.x-plane.com/"
                      target="_blank"

                      the airplane simulator
                    </a>
                    &nbsp;on my laptop, but it didn't work well; it took at
                    least 20 minutes to load the simulator, and often got
                    crashed because my computer was poor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since then, I started to get interested in computers. I was
                    interested in the hardware at that time. I somewhat
                    understood how the components of the computer interact.
                    However, to understand what is going on in deep, I had to
                    understand the software.
                    {/* Mention that I've made a .pub file for this, in the log or smth */}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To do that, I learned how to code. To understand the basic
                    stuff of programming, I started with the simplest and most
                    widely-used language,&nbsp;
                    <a
                      href="https://www.python.org/"
                      target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >
                      Python
                    </a>
                    . I understood what class, function, and variable are while
                    learning that language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Then, I wanted to build an app that can run on any
                    platform.&nbsp;
                    <a
                      href="https://flutter.dev/"
                      target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >
                      Flutter
                    </a>
                    &nbsp;was the exact framework for me. Flutter uses&nbsp;
                    <a
                      href="https://dart.dev/"
                      target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    >
                      Dartlang
                    </a>
                    , so I learned the language to use the framework. I am using
                    Flutter and&nbsp;
                    <a
                      href="https://firebase.google.com/"

                    website would be gradually developed as I keep do
