                  <p>
                    There are a lot of chemical phenomena that fascinate me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For a simple example, I was pouring a handful of salt into
                    the water. I thought that it might be too much, but the
                    water dissolved the salt very well. I poured a little more
                    salt, and the water could still dissolve it. In my view,
                    water was unexceptionally good at dissolving salt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Later, I learned that Oxygen has a higher electronegativity
                    than Hydrogen, which causes the electrons to tend to stay
                    near Oxygen. This eventually causes the polarity of the
                    water molecule, which makes water to be good at dissolving
                    ions and polar molecules.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As it is shown in my experience of pouring salt into the
                    water, many factors are related to a chemical reaction, even
                    if it looks simple. It is interesting for me to learn and
                    research how elements and compounds interact with each
                    other.

                    I used to be interested in airplanes when I was 12. I tried
                    to run&nbsp;

                      an airplane simulator
                    </a>
                    &nbsp;on my laptop, but it didn't work well: it took at
                    least 20 minutes to load the simulator because my computer
                    was poor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Since then, I started to get interested in computers. I was
                    interested in hardware at that time. I somewhat understood
                    how the components of the computer interact. To understand
                    those interactions in deep, I had to understand the
                    software.
                    {/* Mention that I've made a .pub file for this, in the log or smth */}
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To do that, I learned how to code. To understand the basic
                    concepts used in programming, I started with the most
                    widely-used language,&nbsp;
                    <a
                      href="https://www.python.org/"

                      Python
                    </a>
                    . I understood what class, function, variable, etc. are
                    while learning that language.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I wanted to build an app that can run on any platform.&nbsp;
