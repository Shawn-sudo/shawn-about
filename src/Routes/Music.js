      <p>I make musics when I have nothing left to do.</p>
      <p style={{ opacity: 0.2 }}>
        Sometimes, I make music while studying for a test. Tests are inspiring.
      </p>
      <p>They are all incomplete.</p>
      <p>
        It is impossible to
        <ul>
          <li>get a good score in every class</li>
          <li>make my own social media service</li>
          <li>make this website by myself (not using website builders)</li>
          <li>make music professionally</li>
        </ul>
        at once, so I gave up professionally making music .
