          I used to be interested in airplanes when I was 12. I tried to
          run&nbsp;
          <a
            href="https://www.x-plane.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            an airplane simulator
          </a>
          &nbsp;on my laptop, but it didn't work well; the screen was render
          like 1 frame per 3 seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was searching up why this was not working. Since then, I started to
          get interested in computers, especially in hardwares. I somewhat
          understood how the components of the computer (CPU, RAM, GPU,
          mainboard (motherboard / logicboard), sound card, pci lanes for
          connections, I/O ports, ...) interact, but to deeply understand those
          interactions, I had to know the software, too.
          {/* Mention that I've made the computer guide pdf for this, in the log or smth */}
        </p>
        <p>
          I started with the most widely-used language,&nbsp;
          <a
            href="https://www.python.org/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Python
          </a>
          , to understand the basic concepts in programming, such as class,
          variable, function, loops, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, I wanted to build an app using the programming knowledge that I
          learned.{" "}
          <a
            href="https://flutter.dev/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Flutter
          </a>
          &nbsp;was the perfect framework for this, as it supports
          cross-platform app development. I learned&nbsp;
          <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Dart
          </a>
          &nbsp;to use Flutter. After a year of effort, developing it at least 4
          hours a day, I published the app, Atrable, on the Apple App Store.

          <i className="fas fa-arrow-right"></i>
        </Link>
        <p>
          I am also building my website (this one). This website would be
          gradually developed as I keep doing activities ðŸ’ª.
