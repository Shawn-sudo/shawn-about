      <h3>What is the relationship between the pandemic and depression?</h3>
      <p>
        I researched the relationship between the pandemic and depression for my
        I-Search project. I interviewed Mr. Vagnone to get to know depression
        from a scientist's view. I made a simple depression{" "}

        based on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). I organized my

      <h2>Chemistry Club, September 2021 to present</h2>
      <p>
        By listening to others’ presentations, I learned about the interesting
        chemical reactions and how they are researched. I gave a presentation on
        how water dissolves ions and polar molecules with an explanation of
        electronegativity.

      <h2>Math Club, September 2021 to present</h2>
      <p>
        Every week, we participate in math competitions, such as NJML, BCML,
        AMC. I am qualified for AIME for being in the top 2.5% of AMC 10.

      <h2>Creating a Social Media, August 2021 to present</h2>
      <p>
        I am creating an audio-based social media. I was creating an app where
        users can share a post and chat about it. At that time, I started using
        Instagram, and it made me exhausted. Since pictures and videos are
        required for the users to express themselves, they had to reveal their
        appearances. This caused the users, including me, to decorate ourselves
        as a nice guy to the public. As a result, everybody there looked nice.
        Everybody looked nice, and I was so tired of it. I wondered if there was
        a way to express myself without showing me directly, but requires users
        to be more responsible than on text-based social media like Twitter. The
        audio was the solution, so I am creating audio-based social media. I am
        planning to release the first build by this summer.

      <p>
        We gave a presentation for an hour about science technologies in many
        different fields, such as global warming, recombinant DNA technology,
        teeth health, viruses. For another hour, we debated about a topic
        related to the presentation, like Is there any problem with recombinant
        DNA technology?. I gave a presentation on how viruses work, especially
        about coronaviruses, and our body’s reaction to them.

        I met MD. Jeon and researched what Prosthetics & Orthotics do. I learned
        how hand molds are made and how to fabricate medical supportive devices
        based on the mold.

      <h2>The Invention of Fixed Hair Dryer, Spring of 2017</h2>
      <p>
        When I was young, my arms were weak. It was hard for me to use the
        powerful, heavy hair dryer. To make it easy to use the hair dryer, I
        duct-taped it to an old fan. As a result, I could easily dry my hair by
        spinning around the Fixed Hair Dryer. I could also make the fan spin by
        itself, so that heat would not be concentrated.

        In Yeouido Elementary School, every student participates in the school

      <h2>Creating a Website, February 2022</h2>
      <p>
        I made a website to introduce myself (here). Because I made the website
        by writing the code directly, I could customize every single element in
        the website freely.{" "}

      <p>
        I volunteered to monitor water quality in Hongjecheon, a river located
        in Seoul. I could see how pollution differs according to the weather; if
        it rained, the water was more polluted than it was on a sunny day.
