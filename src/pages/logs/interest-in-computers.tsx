              I was interested in airplanes when I was 12. I tried to run&nbsp;
              <a
                href="https://www.x-plane.com/"
                target="_blank"

                an airplane simulator
              </a>
              &nbsp;on my laptop, but it didn't work well: it took like 3
              seconds to render a frame.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was searching up why it was not working. Since then, I started
              to get interested in computers, especially in hardwares. I
              somewhat understood how the components of the computer (CPU, RAM,
              GPU, mainboard (motherboard / logicboard), sound card, pci lanes
              for connections, I/O ports, ...) interact, but to deeply
              understand those interactions, I had to know the software, too.
              {/* Mention that I've made the computer guide pdf for this, in the log or smth */}
            </p>
            <p>
              I started with the most widely-used language,&nbsp;
              <a
                href="https://www.python.org/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >
                Python
              </a>
              , to understand the basic concepts in programming, such as class,
              variable, function, loops, ...
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, I wanted to build an app using the programming knowledge
              that I learned.{" "}
              <a
                href="https://flutter.dev/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >
                Flutter
              </a>
              &nbsp;was the perfect framework for this, as it supports
              cross-platform app development. I learned&nbsp;
              <a
                href="https://dart.dev/"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >
                Dart
              </a>
              &nbsp;to use Flutter. After a year of effort, developing it at
              least 4 hours a day, I published the app, Atrable, on the Apple
              App Store.

            <p>
              I am also building my website (this one). This website would be
              gradually developed as I keep doing activities ðŸ’ª.
