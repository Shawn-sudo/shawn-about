                <h2>Sep - Oct 2022: Changes for v1.2.0</h2>
                <h3>"Post" ‚Üí "Diary"</h3>
                <p>
                  Uploaded audios were being called "Audio Post", but the word
                  "diary" fits better than "post".
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I say it's a "post", it gives me a feeling of disclosing
                  myself to the public. It isn't wrong, but the audios are more
                  daily, personal, reflective, which are closer to diaries.
                </p>
                <h3>Post + Chat</h3>
                <p>
                  I started to think that comments are not for diaries after
                  changing the wordings. Through comments, you literally
                  "comment" on others. This wouldn't be desirable for an
                  uploader who just wants to record their day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Changing the preexisting codes for direct messages a bit, you
                  can send your post to your friends and reply to friends'
                  posts.
                </p>
                <p>Post comments are deprecated.</p>
                <h3>Post Visibility Setting</h3>
                <p>
                  The old db structure for post visibility settings didnn't make
                  sense, so I made some changes. It was quite a huge change.
                </p>

                  I made a video to submit this app to Congressional App
                  Challenge and advertise it at once. I was trying to kill two
                  "birds" with one "stone", but I think I lost both birds; I was
                  being too informal to submit it to the contest, but the video
                  was quite boring to be a good advertisement. I'm going to

                <ul>
                  <li>Replace likes with emoji reactions</li>
                  <dl>
                    "Likes" give me a feeling that I should post something
                    "likeable" (or smth that can be loved by the public). I
                    wanted to feel free to record and share whatever I wanted
                    to, and emoji lets reactions with more diverse emotions.
                  </dl>
                  <li>
                    Replace <code>Share With Friends</code> with{" "}
                    <code>OnlyFriendsPost</code>
                  </li>
                  <dl>
                    The old post visibility settings with{" "}
                    <code>Share With Friends</code> didn't make sense, so I
                    replaced it with <code>OnlyFriendsPost</code>s instead.
                  </dl>
                  <dl>
                    So now, there are 2 type of posts: <code>PublicPost</code>{" "}
                    and <code>OnlyFriendsPost</code>. Anybody can view a{" "}
                    <code>PublicPost</code>, and only friends can view an{" "}
                    <code>OnlyFriendsPost</code>.
                  </dl>
                </ul>

                  I built an app using Flutter by watching tutorials on YouTube,

                  The main focus of the app was to make people share a post and{" "}
                  <strong>directly</strong> chat about it.

                  using React. The purpose was to share your projects and let
