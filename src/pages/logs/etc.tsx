              and deepen my friendships. It did help me increase the number of

              realized that it is possible to form deep relationships on the
              internet when people become more honest with each other. I tried
              making a vlog like him, but it was not easy to fully open up
              myself when I was publishing the video to the general public,
              potentially including hundreds of doubters and haters. There was
              no platform to share vlogs only with friends, and that's why I

              in our school's Methodology of Science Research class, with the
              team name "Watdr". Roll your tongue a little bit at the end to
              pronounce it correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              pH is important in the freshwater ecosystem as it sets up the
              conditions for how easily nutrients are available and how easily
              things like heavy metals can dissolve in the water. Different
              water bodies have different levels of pH, depending on location,
              temperature, and other factors. Moss is a bioindicator, meaning
              that it is a naturally occurring indicator of pollution, air
              quality, and water quality. We wanted to investigate if the
              difference in pH level would affect the biodiversity of the
              inhabiting moss. We also wondered if there would be an ideal pH
              level that allows many different species of moss to inhabit. Our
              hypothesis was that biodiversity would peak as the pH level of
              surrounding water gets closer to 7.
            </p>
            <p>
              We first went to different water streams in our town and collected
              water and moss samples. Then, we went to the Harlem DNA Lab and
              analyzed the diversity of the moss that we collected. We plotted
              out the relationship between pH rate and moss diversity and
              figured out that moss thrives in an environment with a pH of 7.5
            </p>
            <p>
              One unsatisfying part: for our results to be more accurate and
              widely applicable, we had to collect much more samples. As high
              schoolers, we had no time to do more :/

                What is the relationship between the pandemic and depression?

              (Mar 2021)
            </h2>
            <p>
              As a middle school graduation project, I researched the
              relationship between the pandemic and depression. I learned that
              depression happens more widely than I thought, which is mainly
              caused by the COVID pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the project, I made a simple depression test based on PHQ-9
              using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript (
              <a
                href="https://shawn-school.web.app"

              </a>
              ).
            </p>
            <p>
              Later on (around mid-2022), I noticed that the depression rate
              didn't rapidly decrease even though the pandemic was nearly over.
              I realized that the pandemic was just an indirect cause of the
              increased depression rate; the direct cause was increased usage of
              social media, where people often promote unrealistic images of
              themselves or get exhausted from endless entertainment. I wanted
              to make a better place for people to record and share their lives,
              so I brought many shifts to the app that I was making at that
              time. For example, I started focusing on the audio and video on
              the app to encourage people to share their life stories more than
              their appearances.

              I'm not one of the top 100 winners though :/ I think I made a
              similar mistake again! In the presentation, I spent most of my
              time thoroughly explaining the mental health epidemic caused by
              current social media platforms, so I didn't have much time left to
              explain specifically how my app can fix the mental health issues.

              Run the Future taught me the basics of entrepreneurship. Around 30
              of the RISE finalists joined it, and we met on Zoom calls every
              Monday and Wednesday morning. I could meet a lot of like-minded
              people from all around the world, including Ukraine, India,
              Kazakhstan, Turkey, ..., and it was really fun to talk with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing I especially liked about this program was the supportive
              and engaging community. Teachers like Hassan and Godwin had a
              special formula to keep a positive vibe üòé. They strongly
              encouraged us to come up with our ideas and give feedback to each
              other, with the mindset of "Whatever idea you've got, it'll work
              out!" We didn't even meet in person, but I could feel a strong
              sense of community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people did a mental-health related project for their RISE,
              and it was a great experience to talk with them and share our
              journey of tackling mental-health issues.

              Towards the end of the course, we all made a pitch deck for our

              however, I lost touch with them. I have their WhatsApp, but we
              don't have things to talk about. I guess Atrable can come into
              play in such situations one day in the future üòº.

              Studying in school as a student, teaching and grading students as
              a teacher, and keeping our school clean as a custodian can be
              exhausting sometimes. We hope that our friends will get positive

              I learned about interesting chemical reactions by listening to

              dissolves ions and polar molecules with its exceptionally high
              electronegativity.

              We meet every Tuesday afternoon and help kids with their homework

              it's not easy to explain mathematical concepts to others, even
              though I've known those concepts for years. I guess "just knowing"
              and "being able to teach" are really different.

              <p>
                I am creating an audio-based social media. I was creating an app
                where users can share a post and chat about it. At that time, I
                started using Instagram, and it made me exhausted. Since
                pictures and videos are required for the users to express
                themselves, they had to reveal their appearances. This caused
                the users, including me, to decorate ourselves as a nice guy to
                the public. As a result, everybody there looked nice. Everybody
                looked nice, and I was so tired of it. I wondered if there was a
                way to express myself without showing me directly, but requires
                users to be more responsible than on text-based social media
                like Twitter. The audio was the solution, so I am creating
                audio-based social media. I am planning to release the first
                build by this summer.

                When I was young, my arms were weak. It was hard for me to use

                easily dry my hair by spinning around the Fixed Hair Dryer. I
                could also make the fan spin by itself, so that heat would not
