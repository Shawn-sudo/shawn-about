              realized that it is possible to form deep relationships on the
              internet when people become more honest with each other. I tried
              making a vlog like him, but it was not easy to fully open up
              myself when I was publishing the video to the general public,
              potentially including hundreds of doubters and haters. There was
              no platform to share vlogs only with friends, and that's why I

              team name "Watdr". Roll your tongue a little bit at the end to
              pronounce it correctly.

            <p>
              pH is important in the freshwater ecosystem as it sets up the
              conditions for how easily nutrients are available and how easily
              things like heavy metals can dissolve in the water. Different
              water bodies have different levels of pH, depending on location,
              temperature, and other factors. Moss is a bioindicator, meaning
              that it is a naturally occurring indicator of pollution, air
              quality, and water quality. We wanted to investigate if the
              difference in pH level would affect the biodiversity of the
              inhabiting moss. We also wondered if there would be an ideal pH
              level that allows many different species of moss to inhabit. Our
              hypothesis was that biodiversity would peak as the pH level of
              surrounding water gets closer to 7.
            </p>
            <p>
              We first went to different water streams in our town and collected
              water and moss samples. Then, we went to the Harlem DNA Lab and
              analyzed the diversity of the moss that we collected. We plotted
              out the relationship between pH rate and moss diversity and
              figured out that moss thrives in an environment with a pH of 7.5
            </p>
            <p>
              One unsatisfying part: for our results to be more accurate and
              widely applicable, we had to collect much more samples. As high
              schoolers, we had no time to do more :/

              (Mar 2021)
            </h2>
            <p>
              As a middle school graduation project, I researched the
              relationship between the pandemic and depression. I learned that
              depression happens more widely than I thought, which is mainly
              caused by the COVID pandemic.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the project, I made a simple depression test based on PHQ-9
              using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript (
              <a
                href="https://shawn-school.web.app"

              ).
            </p>
            <p>
              Later on (around mid-2022), I noticed that the depression rate
              didn't rapidly decrease even though the pandemic was nearly over.
              I realized that the pandemic was just an indirect cause of the
              increased depression rate; the direct cause was increased usage of
              social media, where people often promote unrealistic images of
              themselves or get exhausted from endless entertainment. I wanted
              to make a better place for people to record and share their lives,
              so I brought many shifts to the app that I was making at that
              time. For example, I started focusing on the audio and video on
              the app to encourage people to share their life stories more than
              their appearances.

                By listening to others' presentations, I learned about
                interesting chemical reactions and how they are researched. I
                gave a presentation on how water dissolves ions and polar
                molecules with an explanation of electronegativity.

              <h2>Creating a Social Media, August 2021 to present</h2>
              <p>
                I am creating an audio-based social media. I was creating an app
                where users can share a post and chat about it. At that time, I
                started using Instagram, and it made me exhausted. Since
                pictures and videos are required for the users to express
                themselves, they had to reveal their appearances. This caused
                the users, including me, to decorate ourselves as a nice guy to
                the public. As a result, everybody there looked nice. Everybody
                looked nice, and I was so tired of it. I wondered if there was a
                way to express myself without showing me directly, but requires
                users to be more responsible than on text-based social media
                like Twitter. The audio was the solution, so I am creating
                audio-based social media. I am planning to release the first
                build by this summer.

                We gave a presentation for an hour about science technologies in

                technology, teeth health, and viruses. For another hour, we
                debated a topic related to the presentation, like "Is there any
                problem with recombinant DNA technology?". I gave a presentation
                on how viruses work, especially about coronaviruses, and our
                body's reaction to them.

              <p>
                When I was young, my arms were weak. It was hard for me to use
                the powerful, heavy hair dryer. To make it easy to use the hair
                dryer, I duct-taped it to an old fan. As a result, I could
                easily dry my hair by spinning around the Fixed Hair Dryer. I
                could also make the fan spin by itself, so that heat would not
                be concentrated.

                I volunteered to monitor water quality in Hongjecheon, a river

                was on a sunny day.
