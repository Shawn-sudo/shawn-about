                  I observed Chemistry Club, and I realized that the president
                  distributes jobs to other officers. That's the leadership
                  right there ðŸ‘†

                <p>
                  Next Monday (Today == Jan 4, 2024), I'm gonna have some
                  conversations with the club officers to give them each
                  platform (among Instagram, YouTube, Google Classroom, and
                  GroupMe) that they'll be responsible for. Our advisor, Mr.
                  Finn, will make sure that we're all doing our jobs well.

                  I heard that smart companies build a <strong>system</strong>{" "}
                  to operate smoothly by giving employees roles &
                  responsibilities. I'm trying to implement that system here ðŸ¤“

                    When together, we have endless potential. Together, we can
                    go to many placesâ€”from senior centers and local restaurants
                    to Times Squareâ€”and perform our music there. To do that,
                    though, we first need a strong, supportive team. Next
                    Monday, I'm going to have conversations with the officers
                    about this too.
                  </p>
                  <p style={{ color: "var(--hint-color)" }}>
                    More explanation: practicing, rehearsing, going to those
                    places, and performing the music consume quite a lot of time
                    & effort. When we put more of our efforts in, we want to
                    have more incentives back, or else we'll easily get
                    depressed and won't put that much effort like before. The
                    crowds' claps would not be enough to keep us motivatedâ€”think
                    about how most pop stars go through burn-out. I think it's
                    because claps just disappear instantaneously. Our buskers's
                    minds would want to get something that won't disappear too
                    quickly by being in this club, and friendship can be an
                    answer! (I'm kinda applying things I learned while
                    developing Atrable lol) That's why I'm trying to build a
                    strong team first.

            <p>
              I wanted to do it in school during lunchtime, so I made Busking
              Club with my friend Ian. We recently did a demo busking, and it
              was great! Everybody loved the idea of seeing their friends
              singing some songs for them. Even the teachers loved it; one of
              them told us how great it is to bring positive energy to our
              community by busking during lunchtime. I think it's great too!
