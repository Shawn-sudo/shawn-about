                  I re-rendered the video 17 times to put on YouTube because of
                  some weird visual effect caused by video file corruption. I
                  personally liked it, but I thought I would be the only one who
                  liked it, so I tried removing those effects.

                  Apparently, I was experiencing this issue because there was
                  not enough space left in my main drive. I exported the video
                  on another drive and those visual effects are gone now. Phew.

              I've been wanting to do busking after hearing that Busker Busker,
              a famous band in Korea that made many songs like{" "}

              , used to do busking in their early 20s.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to do it in school during lunchtime, so I made Busking
              Club with my friend Ian. We recently did a demo busking, and it
              was great! Everybody loved the idea of seeing their friends
              singing some songs for them. Even the teachers loved it; one of
              them told us how great it is to bring positive energy to our
              community by busking during lunchtime. I think it's great too!

              We'll be doing this every week starting the next year. You can
